# Military Intervention and crowdsourced data

This is a personal project. I've developed a website for visualizing fire arm usage data in Rio during the initial period of military intervention. I'm using data fetch by [Fogo Cruzado](www.fogocruzado.org.br)

## To run:

`$ gem install middleman`

`$ bundle install`

`$ bundle exec middleman build`
